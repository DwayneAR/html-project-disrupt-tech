					<b>Disruptive Technology and the media</b>
					<br/>
					Over time, the media is becoming highly used and abused in many ways due to the uprise of internet and apps.
					However, studies show its starting to lose its flare due to one aspect which was labelled an <i>improvement</i>
					- The speed of the internet

		<p align="center">The <b>Internet</b> is the decisive technology of the Information Age,
			and with the explosion of wireless communication in the early twenty-first century, 
			we can say that humankind is now almost entirely connected, albeit with great levels of 
			inequality in bandwidth, efficiency, and price.
		</h3>
		</p>
		<p align="center"><strong><h3>
			 People, companies, and institutions feel the depth of this technological change,
			 but the speed and scope of the transformation has triggered all manner of utopian
			 and dystopian perceptions that, when examined closely through methodologically rigorous
			 empirical research, turn out not to be accurate. For instance, <b>media</b> often report that
			 intense use of the Internet increases the risk of <b>"isolation, alienation, and withdrawal"</b>
			 from society, but available evidence shows that the Internet neither isolates people nor
			 reduces their sociability; it actually increases sociability, civic engagement, and the
			 intensity of family and friendship relationships, in all cultures.

					<strong>
					 Our current <b><i>network society</i></b> is a product of the digital revolution
					 and some major sociocultural changes.<br/> One of these is the rise of the "Me-centered society",
					 marked by an increased focus on individual growth and a decline in community understood in
					 terms of space, work, family, and ascription in general. But individuation does not mean
					 isolation, or the end of community. Instead, social relationships are being reconstructed
					 on the basis of individual interests, values, and projects.<br/><br/>Community is formed through individuals'
					 quests for like-minded people in a process that combines online interaction with offline interaction,
					 cyberspace, and the local space.
					 <br/>
					 <br/>
					 <p>
						Globally, time spent on social networking sites surpassed time spent on e-mail in November 2007,
						and the number of social networking users surpassed the number of e-mail users in July 2009. Today,
						social networking sites are the preferred platforms for all kinds of activities, both business and
						personal, and sociability has dramatically increased - but it is a different kind of sociability.
						Most Facebook users visit the site daily, and they connect on multiple dimensions, but only
						on the dimensions they choose. The virtual life is becoming more social than the physical
						life, but it is less a virtual reality than a real virtuality, facilitating real-life work and urban living.
