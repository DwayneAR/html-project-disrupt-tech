					<b>Disruptive Technology and Govenment</b>
					<br/>
					 The disruptive potential of digital technologies has become a hot topic in recent years.
					 There are calls for governments to add or remove regulations, invest in digital start ups,
					 and protect the jobs of workers threatened by new ways of doing business.

			 This research paper reviews and interprets expert opinion on disruption in order to inform governments about the policy tasks posed
			 by digital technologies. For the Commission, this review sets a broader framing for the formal inquiries
			 into Data Availability and Use, and Intellectual Property Arrangements. It also provides context for important
			 work that we expect to come to us on productivity growth in a time of apparent digital transformation.
			 
			 <br/>
			 <br/>
			     With rapid advances in computing power, connectivity, mobility, and data storage capacity over the last few decades,
				 digital technologies offer opportunities for higher productivity growth and improvements in living standards. But they 
				 also pose risks of higher inequality and dislocation of labour and capital. Speculation about the effects of technologies often
				 suffer from extreme optimism or pessimism. In the 1930s, several countries were enthusiastically experimenting with using new rocket
				 technology to deliver mail, and in 1959, the United States trialed mail delivery via cruise missile, a proposition that could now be
				 regarded as comical. The Commission has attempted to avoid the overly excited or dire views of the impacts of current digital technologies,
				 while recognizing their potential where evident.

			There is much governments can do to enable the creation and take up of digital reform opportunities without favoring particular technologies. In markets that
			 are currently highly regulated but where digital technologies allow more producers - electricity generation is one such case - governments will need to review
			 the institutional and regulatory arrangements to ensure that new technologies can compete for market share. More generally, standards to support interoperability
			 of digital technologies and ensuring investment in enabling infrastructures (such as reliable and readily upgradeable communications networks), can help with rapid
			 technological diffusion.
			<br/>

				There will be adjustments that come with digital disruption. Some workers will struggle to adjust to changes in demand for their skills and new, more flexible but
				 less reliable, work options. Australia's social safety net will remain important in mitigating risks for workers and lessening the effects of a widening distribution
				 in incomes. Broader protections for an individual's rights (such as with control of personal information) and to support society's moral and ethical mores
				 (relevant to technological advancements into artificial intelligence, remote sensing and medical research) will require ongoing government attention informed by
				 scientific evidence.
