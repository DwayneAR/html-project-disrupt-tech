					<b>Disruptive Technology and Educational Affects</b>
					<br/>
					 The interference of technology is starting to take its effects on education over the years. With the introduction of
					 ebook, powerpoints and online classes, education is now easier to reach and somewhat more affordable. However, not all
					 improvements have good results.

			Excitement about the role of technology in improving education is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.
			Education is a segment that needs disruptive innovation. To me the hype around things like MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) represents 
			a longing by many for "a better educational future" - presumably involving lower costs to students and better
			career/life fulfillment, not to mention better global citizens needed to solve our global challenges. Let's face it
			- there is a general sense that the current education system is not up to the challenges of the future. And, it's 
			not clear how we get from "here" to "there."

				But, as leaders in the education segment we do need to get better at understanding where we have been and where
				we are going, what constitutes innovation and/or disruption that is worthy of investment?  Are you an investor?
				I would argue that any individual that is putting time into educational technology leadership at any level is an
				investor, but certainly institutions that are spending on innovation, and yes, venture capital investors (investors
				in this segment, including some pretty big names, are making some bad decisions right now about where they are putting
				their money - but this post is more about how institutions should decide to invest their resources).

						 Education is a complex services business in which quality is difficult to define. Disruption in the education space requires
						 better service models that are built around improved educational program quality. Comparison of education to the disruption
						 of the steel industry by mini-mills (a connection some have made because Christensen uses this as a classic example of disruption)
						 is not a valid comparison. Disruption in education is not about replacing the low end of a well-defined product. It's about redefining
						 quality in a much more complex world of knowledge than that from which most current educational models were designed. So, for instance,
						 a true disruption in education would be highly desirable/effective K-masters degree in 15-16 years versus the current 19 years
						 (ideally that meets the needs of under performing populations as well as traditionally successful populations).

							 The next phase of true progress will be to come out of the current era of massification into a new era of more real world
							 relevant and personalized educational pathways.  Massification of educational experiences will not be the ticket to success
							 in the next wave of educational models. It seems that many of the entrepreneurs and investors in the education space fail to
							 realize that we have already been in the era of massification of education for the last 30 years or so in developed countries.
							 The disruption in terms of content will need to be content that enables educational experiences that are up-to-date (read "relevant"),
							 adaptive to the interests of the learner, easily adaptable by teachers and yet thorough in terms of teaching the educational foundation
							 that are defined via #1.
